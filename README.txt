1. joint_Corpus.txt was prepared to do test-train split from main corpus, which is later used in both models and their inference codes.
2. a) File name for plain encoder decoder training model - Seq2Seq_Keras_Training_Assignment2_v1.ipynb
   b) File name for encoder-decoder Inference model - Seq2Seq_Keras_Inference_Assignment2.ipynb
   c) File name for encoder-decoder with Attention training model - Seq2Seq_attention_training_Assignment2.ipynb
   d) File name for encoder-decoder with Attention Inference model - Seq2Seq_AttentionB_Keras_Inf_Assignment2.ipynb


3. a) Test prediction of 1000 test sentence using plain encoder-decoder model - test_prediction_without_attention
   b) Test prediction of 1000 test sentence using encoder-decoder with attention model - test_prediction

4. Word document of report is attached which shows 20 sentence predicted translation
5. Trained Model is placed at google drive.
